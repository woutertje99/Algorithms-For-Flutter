## Features

My package is a simple one, containing a multitude of various sorting algorithms as of version one.
This will eventually extend to include more algorithms, maybe even pathfinding ones like A*

## Getting started

Simply import the package in your dart file and use it like you would any other. Example code down below.

## Usage



```dart
Algorithms algo = new Algorithms();
algo.bubbleSort(List);
```

## Additional information

Any ideas as to how to further improve the package can be sent through issues. 
I am however a college student, and it might take some time to fully implement, so sending your own code is appreciated even more!
